                <h1>Aria Oslo is a digital artist based in Moontown, USA.</h1>
                <p>She focuses on juxtaposing portraiture with geometric abstraction, a nod to her first career as an
                    architectural technician working on shaping cityscapes. Aria graduated from Oregon State University
                    in 2012 with an art history degree, where she discovered her love for the Orphism art movement - her
                    graduate project was a 3d puzzle and art piece titled Moving On. After deciding to go back to her
                    art roots, Aria launched her 3d puzzle on Kickstarter in 2017 and left her day job. She now produces
                    digital artwork for advertising, commissions and sells prints on her online shop, Orpheum.</p>
                <p>When Aria is not creating art, she's exploring the Pacific Northwest, reading mystery novels, and
                    hosting board game nights. She can also be found mulling over all kinds of puzzle pieces,
                    contemplating how it all fits together and how art imitates life (or is it the other way around?).
